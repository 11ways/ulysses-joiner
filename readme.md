# Ulysses â†’ Deckset

> This command line tool makes it really easy to automatically generate Deckset presentations from a Ulysses content folder. 

**ulysses2deckset** watches a content folder in Ulysses and automatically rebuilds your Deckset slidedeck whenever you save a Ulysses sheet ('slide'), drag them in a different order or change their folder hierarchy. 

For this command line tool to work, you need these two great Mac apps as well:

- [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/) - The Ultimate Writing App for Mac, iPad and iPhone
- [Deckset](https://decksetapp.com/) - Great-looking slides from simple Markdown files in no time

## Installation

- Run `npm install` first
- Run `ulysses2deckset` in the folder you want to watch.
